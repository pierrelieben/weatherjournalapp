# Weather-Journal App Project

## Overview
This project required was to create an asynchronous web app that uses Web API and user data to dynamically update the UI. I have taken initiative to update the styling with TailwindCSS, a lovely framework I highly recommend. The app calls data from openweather's api to give you the ability to journal per day with the weather attached.

## SETUP Instructions 
1. Make sure Node JS is installed. 
2. Run the server with 'node server.js'. Make sure you are in the root directory. 

## Deps
This project uses Tailwindcss to power styling. To simply run the app you do not have to worry about installing tailwind, but if you want to use the project for dev purposes visit tailwindcss.com and follow the instructions.
